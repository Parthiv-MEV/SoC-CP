# Competitive Programming Skills Development Project

## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains my 6-week intensive competitive programming journey, where I systematically developed algorithmic problem-solving skills through structured learning and extensive practice. The project includes solutions to **80+ problems** from multiple platforms, contest participation, and comprehensive implementation of fundamental to advanced algorithms.

## üéØ Learning Objectives Achieved

- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Developed systematic approach to problem decomposition
- **Data Structure Mastery**: Implemented and optimized core data structures
- **Contest Performance**: Improved coding speed and accuracy under time pressure
- **Platform Diversity**: Gained experience across multiple competitive programming environments

## üìö Curriculum Structure

### Week 1: Sorting and Searching
- Implemented various sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort)
- Mastered binary search and its variants
- Solved optimization problems using search techniques

### Weeks 2-3: Data Structures Deep Dive
- **Stack**: Expression evaluation, parentheses matching
- **Heap**: Priority queues, efficient min/max operations
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic data manipulation, doubly linked lists
- **Queue/Deque**: BFS implementation, sliding window problems

### Week 4: Graphs and Trees
- Graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall)
- Tree algorithms (traversals, LCA, tree DP)

### Weeks 5-6: Dynamic Programming
- Basic DP concepts (Fibonacci, coin change)
- Advanced DP techniques (multi-dimensional states)
- Optimization strategies and space complexity reduction

## üìÅ File Organization
